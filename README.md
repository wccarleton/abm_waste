# An Agent-Based Model for Evaluating the Waste Hypothesis
## Overview
This repo contains the NetLogo source code and R data analysis scripts for the study presented in the following paper:

*Carleton, McAuley, Costopoulos, and Collard (In Prep) "An evolutionary agent-based model contradicts Dunnellâ€™s waste hypothesis for cultural elaboration".*


## NetLogo
Netlogo is a freely available Java-based program with a purpose-made programming language (i.e., a *Logo*) for defining agent-based models and running simulations.

To make use of the NetLogo source file, first download the latest version of [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml).

## R scripts
The R scripts contained in the ./R/ folder of this repository are intended for replication efforts and to improve the transparency of our research. They are, of coruse, provided without warranty or technical support. That said, questions about the code can be directed to Chris Carleton at w.ccarleton@gmail.com.
